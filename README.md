# Uber-Clone

Uber-Clone is an MVP practice project. Users are asked for their current location and also where they want to be dropped off. Based on the distance between pick-up and drop-off location, a quota is being calculated which varies for the three types of rides available.

Frameworks:
* UIKit 
* MapKit

Language:
* Swift

Architecture:
* Model-View-Controller

Third-Party Libraries:
* None

Things I learned:
* Feed the app dummy JSON data for testing purposes
* Work with CLLocationManager
* Create MapView Annotations
